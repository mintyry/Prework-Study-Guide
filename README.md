# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a study guide made for prework, providing a brief introduction into the coding bootcamp. This was made for students to have a cohensive reference guide on some of the topics we will be learning throughout the course. We built this application via HTML, CSS, JavaScript along with the help of Git and Terminal. This application aims to solve the problem of a disorganized structure going into learning these topics. Throughout this project, I learned how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build what you are seeing right now. Along the way, I also learned how to use Terminal and Git in order to construct this guide's webpage.
